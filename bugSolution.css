/* Solution: Avoid mixing percentages and viewport units in calc() */
#myElement {
  width: 50vw;
  /* Alternative: Use absolute units or a different approach */
  /* width: calc(50% - 20px);  */
}
/*Further solutions depend on the specifics of the problematic calculation.  Consider restructuring calculations to use either percentages or viewport units, but not both in combination within calc().*/
